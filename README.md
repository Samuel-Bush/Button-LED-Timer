# Button-LED-Timer

A simple Python + Raspberry Pi system that measures the duration a button is pressed for my first project.

# What It Does

- LED turns on when button is pressed down.
- LED turns off when button is released.
- Duration of the button press outputted upon release.

# Hardware Used

- Raspberry Pi 3B
- Push button
- 220Ω resistor (for LED)
- Breadboard
- GPIO extension board
- Jumper wires

  # Important

  - The LED is wired to the GPIO22 pin, and the button to GPIO17. If these exact pins are not used, the code will need to be adapted.
