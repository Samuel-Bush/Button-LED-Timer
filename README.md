# Button-LED-Timer 

A simple Python + Raspberry Pi system that measures the duration a button is pressed for my first project.

# What It Does

- LED turns on when button is pressed down.
- LED turns off when button is released.
- Duration of the button press outputted upon release.

# Hardware Used

- Raspberry Pi 3B
- Push button
- 220Ω resistor (for LED)
- Breadboard
- GPIO extension board
- Jumper wires

  # What I Learnt

- Understanding of the breadboard system (such as rails).
- Creating program logic that uses the GPIO pins.

 # Note
 - The hardware must be wired to the GPIO pins used in the buttonLEDtimer.py file.
 - If GPIO17 & GPIO22 aren't used, the code must be updated accordingly.
